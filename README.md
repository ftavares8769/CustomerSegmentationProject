# CustomerSegmentationProject
This project uses K-Means and PCA to segment 2,240 customers into four strategic personas. It analyzes how demographics and household composition drive purchasing patterns in wine, meat, and fresh produce. The goal is to optimize marketing spend by replacing broad outreach with data-driven, tailored campaign strategies.
